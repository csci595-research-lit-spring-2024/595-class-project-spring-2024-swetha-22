\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:into} % This how you label a chapter and the key (e.g., ch:into) will be used to refer this chapter ``Introduction'' later in the report. 
% the key ``ch:into'' can be used with command \ref{ch:intor} to refere this Chapter.
Today, heart problems are major health concern affecting individuals worldwide. Many people are suffering from heart issues like heart disease, heart failure, and irregular heartbeats nowadays. Heart problems can affect people, not just physically but also emotionally. Those with heart conditions often find it difficult to live normally and face many difficulties. Plus, the financial side of managing heart problems adds additional. Spotting heart-related issues early is crucial. It helps healthcare professionals to step in quickly, enhance patient outcomes, and ease the strain on healthcare resources. To detect heart diseases there is a need to develop a machine learning model  that can accurately detect the presence of heart diseases. In our project, a heart-related issue dataset \cite{misc_heart_disease_45} is taken from an online source, UC Irvine, and data is cleaned are pre-processed to extract the useful information that can be used to train the machine learning model. Some machine learning algorithms \cite{9362842} that are used are Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, and Random Forest classification which can detect coronary artery disease. They evaluate output based on various factors such as resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, maximum heart rate achieved, etc. These algorithms ensure effective prediction of heart-related issues.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:into_back}
Describe to a reader the context of your project. That is, what is your project and what its motivation. Briefly explain the major theories, applications, and/or products/systems/algorithms whichever is relevant to your project.

\textbf{Cautions:} Do not say you choose this project because of your interest, or your supervisor proposed/suggested this project, or you were assigned this project as your final year project. This all may be true, but it is not meant to be written here.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Problem statement}
\label{sec:intro_prob_art}
This section describes the investigated problem in detail. You can also have a separate chapter on ``Problem articulation.''  For some projects, you may have a section like ``Research question(s)'' or ``Research Hypothesis'' instead of a section on ``Problem statement.'

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Aims and objectives}
\label{sec:intro_aims_obj}
Describe the ``aims and objectives'' of your project. 

\textbf{Aims:} The aims tell a read what you want/hope to achieve at the end of the project. The  aims define your intent/purpose in general terms.  

\textbf{Objectives:} The objectives are a set of tasks you would perform in order to achieve the defined aims. The objective statements have to be specific and measurable through the results and outcome of the project.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Solution approach}
\label{sec:intro_sol} % label of Org section
Briefly describe the solution approach and the methodology applied in solving the set aims and objectives.

Depending on the project, you may like to alter the ``heading'' of this section. Check with you supervisor. Also, check what subsection or any other section that can be added in or removed from this template.

\subsection{A subsection 1}
\label{sec:intro_some_sub1}
You may or may not need subsections here. Depending on your project's needs, add two or more subsection(s). A section takes at least two subsections. 

\subsection{A subsection 2}
\label{sec:intro_some_sub2}
Depending on your project's needs, add more section(s) and subsection(s).

\subsubsection{A subsection 1 of a subsection}
\label{sec:intro_some_subsub1}
The command \textbackslash subsubsection\{\} creates a paragraph heading in \LaTeX.

\subsubsection{A subsection 2 of a subsection}
\label{sec:intro_some_subsub2}
Write your text here...

\section{Summary of contributions and achievements} %  use this section 
\label{sec:intro_sum_results} % label of summary of results
Describe clearly what you have done/created/achieved and what the major results and their implications are. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Organization of the report} %  use this section
\label{sec:intro_org} % label of Org section
Describe the outline of the rest of the report here. Let the reader know what to expect ahead in the report. Describe how you have organized your report. 

\textbf{Example: how to refer a chapter, section, subsection}. This report is organised into seven chapters. Chapter~\ref{ch:lit_rev} details the literature review of this project. In Section~\ref{ch:method}...  % and so on.

\textbf{Note:}  Take care of the word like ``Chapter,'' ``Section,'' ``Figure'' etc. before the \LaTeX command \textbackslash ref\{\}. Otherwise, a  sentence will be confusing. For example, In \ref{ch:lit_rev} literature review is described. In this sentence, the word ``Chapter'' is missing. Therefore, a reader would not know whether 2 is for a Chapter or a Section or a Figure.
