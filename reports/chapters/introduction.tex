Today, heart problems are a major health concern affecting individuals worldwide. Many people are suffering from heart issues like heart disease, heart failure, and irregular heartbeats nowadays. Heart problems can affect people, not just physically but also emotionally. Those with heart conditions often find it difficult to live normally and face many difficulties. Additionally, the financial side of managing heart problems adds an extra layer of challenges. Spotting heart-related issues early is crucial. It helps healthcare professionals to step in quickly, enhance patient outcomes, and ease the strain on healthcare resources. Early detection allows for timely intervention, potentially preventing the progression of heart conditions.To address the need for early detection, our project focuses on developing a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying the presence of heart diseases. In this endeavor, we utilize a heart-related issue dataset from Janosi and Detrano (1988), sourced from the online repository UC Irvine. The data undergoes thorough cleaning and pre-processing to extract useful information essential for training the machine learning model. The machine learning algorithms employed, as highlighted by Sharma et al. (2020), include Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest classification. These algorithms have demonstrated effectiveness in detecting coronary artery disease by evaluating outputs based on various factors such as resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, maximum heart rate achieved, and more. Furthermore, our project aims not only to detect heart-related issues but also to contribute valuable insights to the broader field of cardiovascular health. By leveraging advanced algorithms, we seek to ensure the effective prediction of heart-related problems, potentially revolutionizing the early diagnosis and management of cardiovascular conditions.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:into_back}
Our project focuses on addressing the issue of cardiovascular diseases in today's world, affecting everyone irrespective of their age. The primary motivation behind our work is to detect the heart-related diseases as early as possible. This identification helps doctors to start the treatment sooner, to improve patient results and effectively using the healthcare resources. For this, our project focuses on integrating technology into healthcare by using the abundant data in cardiology for predictive modeling. The primary goal is to develop an efficient heart disease prediction system by concentrating on predicting Coronary Artery Disease with precision and effectiveness. So, we use different machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. These models play a crucial role in predicting and understanding heart-related issues. The initial phase involves cleaning and preprocessing the data to extract necessary patterns required for training the models. Our project becomes significant as it can give better resources to doctors for finding and handling heart problems early on. We want to help make hearts healthier by explaining some crucial ideas and ways to use them in a simple way.

Briefly describe the solution approach and the methodology applied in solving the set aims and objectives.

Depending on the project, you may like to alter the ``heading'' of this section. Check with you supervisor. Also, check what subsection or any other section that can be added in or removed from this template.

\subsection{A subsection 1}
\label{sec:intro_some_sub1}
You may or may not need subsections here. Depending on your project's needs, add two or more subsection(s). A section takes at least two subsections. 

\subsection{A subsection 2}
\label{sec:intro_some_sub2}
Depending on your project's needs, add more section(s) and subsection(s).

\subsubsection{A subsection 1 of a subsection}
\label{sec:intro_some_subsub1}
The command \textbackslash subsubsection\{\} creates a paragraph heading in \LaTeX.

\subsubsection{A subsection 2 of a subsection}
\label{sec:intro_some_subsub2}
Write your text here...

Describe the outline of the rest of the report here. Let the reader know what to expect ahead in the report. Describe how you have organized your report. 

\textbf{Example: how to refer a chapter, section, subsection}. This report is organised into seven chapters. Chapter~\ref{ch:lit_rev} details the literature review of this project. In Section~\ref{ch:method}...  % and so on.

\textbf{Note:}  Take care of the word like ``Chapter,'' ``Section,'' ``Figure'' etc. before the \LaTeX command \textbackslash ref\{\}. Otherwise, a  sentence will be confusing. For example, In \ref{ch:lit_rev} literature review is described. In this sentence, the word ``Chapter'' is missing. Therefore, a reader would not know whether 2 is for a Chapter or a Section or a Figure.
