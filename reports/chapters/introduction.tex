Today, heart problems are a major health concern affecting individuals worldwide. Many people 
are suffering from heart issues like heart disease, heart failure, and irregular heartbeats \cite{webb2015care}. Heart problems can affect people, not just physically but also emotionally. Those 
with heart conditions often find it difficult to live normally and face many difficulties.
Additionally, the financial side of managing heart problems adds an extra layer of challenges. 
Spotting heart-related issues early is crucial. It helps healthcare professionals to step in 
quickly, enhance patient outcomes, and ease the strain on healthcare resources. Early detection  
allows for timely intervention, potentially preventing the progression of heart conditions.To 
address the need for early detection, our project focuses on developing a machine learning 
model capable of accurately identifying the presence of heart diseases. In this endeavor, we 
utilize a heart-related issue dataset from \citep{janosi-1988}, sourced from the online 
repository UC Irvine. The data undergoes thorough cleaning and pre-processing to extract useful 
information essential for training the machine learning model. The machine learning algorithms 
employed, as highlighted by \citep{Sharma-2020}, include LR, NB, and 
RF classification. These algorithms have demonstrated effectiveness in detecting 
coronary artery disease by evaluating outputs based on various factors such as resting blood 
pressure, serum cholesterol, maximum heart rate achieved, and more. Furthermore, our project 
aims not only to detect heart-related issues but also to contribute valuable insights to the 
broader field of cardiovascular health. By leveraging advanced algorithms, we seek to ensure 
the effective prediction of heart-related problems, potentially revolutionizing the early 
diagnosis and management of cardiovascular conditions.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:into_back}
Our project focuses on addressing the issue of cardiovascular diseases in today's world, 
affecting everyone irrespective of their age. The primary motivation behind our work is to 
detect the heart-related diseases as early as possible. This identification helps doctors to 
start the treatment sooner, to improve patient results and effectively using the healthcare 
resources. For this, our project focuses on integrating technology into healthcare by using the 
abundant data in cardiology for predictive modeling. The primary goal is to develop an 
efficient heart disease prediction system by concentrating on predicting CAD with precision and effectiveness. So, we use different machine learning models such as 
LR, RF, NB. These models play a crucial role in 
predicting and understanding heart-related issues. The project commences with data preprocessing to extract essential patterns required for training the models, aligning with the objectives and research approach outlined in subsequent sections. Our 
project becomes significant as it can give better resources to doctors for finding and handling 
heart problems early on. We want to help make hearts healthier by explaining some crucial ideas 
and ways to use them in a simple way.

\label{sec:intro_sol} % label of Org section
The solution approach involves a thorough step-by-step method designed to create an advanced 
system for predicting heart disease, specifically focusing on early detection of CAD, with the ultimate goal of achieving our defined aim and objectives. The 
project commences with the acquisition of a dataset related to cardiac issues obtained from the 
research conducted by \cite{janosi-1988}, which is accessible through UC Irvine. Following 
that, we carefully clean and process the data to find important patterns needed for training 
our machine learning models. We incorporate technology into healthcare by using different smart 
algorithms, like LR, NB, and RF classification. These 
specific algorithms are chosen because they are proficient in effectively CAD, by taking into account key factors such as resting blood pressure, serum 
cholesterol, and maximum heart rate achieved. The models are evaluated using specific metrics 
like precision, recall, and the F1 score to provide us with the understanding of how well they 
are performing.
