The literature review looks into the current state of cardiovascular disease research, highlighting its global impact across different age groups. Many recent studies show worry about heart problems like disease, failure, and abnormal rhythms, which hurt people's bodies and emotions. Identifying the health issues sooner could help the doctors to respond fast, improve the patient results, effectively utilize the health care resources. [4] Janosi and Detrano's (1988) heart-related issue dataset from UC Irvine serves as a valuable resource for our project, showing how existing data can be helpful in medicine. [5] The study by Sharma et al. (2020) reinforces the significance of employing machine learning algorithms, specifically Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, and Random Forest classification, for accurate detection of coronary artery disease. Studies show that things like how high your blood pressure is at rest, how much cholesterol you have in your blood (serum cholesterol), and how fast your heart beats during exercise are all important for figuring out if someone might have heart disease. Our project mainly focuses on integrating technology into healthcare, aligning with the existing literature. [6] Looking at past research on heart disease prediction shows what are the necessary improvements and different ways to predict and understand heart problems. By addressing these gaps, our project helps doctors find and treat heart problems as soon as possible, which is btter for patients and hospitals. The literature review emphasizes our significant impact in contributing to the ongoing efforts to combat cardiovascular diseases and underscores the need for advanced predictive tools to address this global health challenge.
