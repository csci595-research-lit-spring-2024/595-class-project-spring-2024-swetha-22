Recently cardiovascular diseases has been on the rise, even affecting newborns. 
Detecting heart-related diseases early is vital because it helps doctors start treatment 
sooner, leading to better results for patients and less strain on healthcare resources. With 
more and more people facing heart problems, it's crucial to have advanced predictive tools. 
Using the abundant data available in cardiology, our project aims to integrate the technology 
into health care for predictive modelling. The primary goal of this project is to develop an 
efficient heart disease prediction system using various machine learning models to predict 
coronary artery disease(CAD) with utmost precision and effectiveness. We employed a dataset 
consisting of necessary patient information from online sources to train and validate our 
models. The first step is cleaning and preprocessing data that allow us to find key patterns 
for training the models. This research trains a Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF) and Naive Bayes (NB) model for classification on the heart disease dataset. We evaluate these models using standard measures like precision, 
which tells us how accurate positive predictions are; recall, which shows how well the models 
capture all actual positive cases; and the F1 score, which balances both precision and recall.
